## Overview

This project implements a multilingual intent classification and fallback system for voice assistants, designed and developed by Dragomir Bozoki in collaboration with the University of Patras and the ESDA Lab. It integrates a fine-tuned transformer-based classifier, semantic retrieval using FAISS, and optional generative fallback mechanisms into the open-source Kalliope voice assistant platform.
Objective

The primary goal of this project is to enable robust and flexible understanding of spoken commands in smart environments. The system is capable of classifying user intents with high accuracy and gracefully handling unexpected or ambiguous queries through semantic or generative fallback mechanisms.
Motivation and Usefulness

Voice assistants are increasingly used in smart homes, assistive technologies, and context-aware systems. However, most assistants rely on rigid command matching and often fail to interpret unfamiliar phrasing or multilingual input. This project addresses that gap by offering:

    Multilingual support based on fine-tuned transformer models

    Semantic fallback when classification confidence is low

    Dynamic generative responses for queries beyond the trained set

    Easy extensibility through modular dataset updates

The resulting system is highly adaptable and suitable for deployment in diverse environments, including educational, domestic, and research contexts.

## üîß Setup Instructions

---

### 1. Required Files for Classifier

These are the essential files needed to **train** and **run** the intent classification model and FAISS model:

You must manually place the required model files under:
~kalliope/Chatbot/models/intent-medium-model-multilang-v2.0/
These files are large and are excluded via .gitignore.


---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ESDA-LAB/Alexandra-AI-chatbot.git
cd Alexandra-AI-chatbot/Chatbot

python3 -m venv kalliope_venv
source kalliope_venv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

üéì Training the Classifier

1. Prepare your training data:
```bash
{"instruction": "Classify the intent of the following sentence.", "input": "turn on the kitchen light please", "output": "kitchen-on"}
```
Examples for Alexandra Voice Assistant are in QuestionChatBot/dataset/.

Run the training script:
```bash
python3 QuestionChatBot/training.py
```
  
3. After training completes, your model will be saved in:
```bash
models/intent-medium-model-multilang-v2.0/
```
Modifying or Extending the Dataset - add new examples or new folder in Datasets/name_of_json_file.jsonl
 
```bash
{"instruction": "Classify the intent of the following sentence.", "input": "I am done reading a book", "output": "reading-off"}
```

TalkChatBot: Hybrid Classifier with Generative Fallback

TalkChatBot combines a trained intent classifier (BERT model) with semantic search using FAISS and optional generative fallback using GPT-2. This hybrid architecture ensures both precision and flexibility in understanding voice commands or user queries.
üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training the Intent Classifier

The intent classifier is a fine-tuned transformer (like BERT) that maps input queries to predefined command labels (kitchen-on, lab-off, etc.).

üìÅ Dataset Format

Training data is stored in JSONL files like:
```bash
{
  "instruction": "Classify the intent.",
  "input": "Turn on the lights in the kitchen",
  "output": "kitchen-on"
}
```
Multiple examples should be added in:
```bash
QuestionChatBot/dataset/*.jsonl
```

You can group intents into files such as lights.jsonl, ambient.jsonl, radio.jsonl, etc.
üöÄ Train the Classifier

Run the following script:
```bash
python3 QuestionChatBot/training.py
```
The trained model will be saved to:
```bash
models/intent-medium-model-multilang-v2.0/
```

###  Building the FAISS Index (Semantic Fallback)

FAISS is used when the classifier isn't confident (confidence < 0.9). It retrieves the most similar question from your dataset.

Dataset for Retrieval
Your retrieval dataset should also be in JSONL format, e.g.:
```bash
{
  "instruction": "Classify the intent.",
  "input": "Turn on the lights in the kitchen",
  "output": "kitchen-on"
}
```

Stored in
```bash
TalkChatBot/dataset/train_dataset/esdalab_english.jsonl
```
Build the FAISS index:

Use this script (or create build_faiss.py):
```bash
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss, json, numpy as np

with open("TalkChatBot/dataset/train_dataset/esdalab_english.jsonl") as f:
    entries = [json.loads(l) for l in f]
    questions = [e["input"] for e in entries]

embedder = SentenceTransformer("paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2")
embeddings = embedder.encode(questions)

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(np.array(embeddings))

faiss.write_index(index, "faiss/esdalab_index.bin")
with open("faiss/esdalab_texts.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(questions, f, indent=2)
```

### Classifier Architecture and Integration with Kalliope

The system is built around a hybrid intent classification pipeline that combines a fine-tuned transformer-based classifier, semantic retrieval using FAISS, and an optional generative fallback. This design ensures robust handling of both known and previously unseen user inputs in natural language.

## 1. Classification Workflow

## Step 1: Speech-to-Text (STT)

Kalliope captures the user's voice through a microphone and converts it into text using a speech recognition engine. The transcribed text is passed to the classifier module for intent detection.
Step 2: Intent Classification

    The transcribed text is processed using a fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., BERT).

    The model outputs a label (e.g., "kitchen-on") and a confidence score.

    If the confidence score is ‚â• 0.9, the predicted label is accepted and returned.

    If the confidence score is < 0.9, semantic fallback is triggered.

## Step 2: Semantic Fallback with FAISS

    FAISS retrieves the most semantically similar query from a prepared training dataset.

    If a suitable match is found, its associated label is returned.

    If no appropriate label is identified, a fallback mechanism returns a dynamic message or triggers a generative model response.

    3. Kalliope Integration
    
## Synapse for Direct Intent Execution

Each classified label must correspond to a synapse in the Kalliope brain.yml:
```bash
- name: "kitchen-on"
  signals:
    - order: "kitchen-on"
  neurons:
    - say:
        message: "Turning on the kitchen lights."
    - shell:
        cmd: "python3 scripts/kitchen_on.py"
```
## Synapse for Generative Fallback

If no high-confidence intent is predicted, the classifier returns a dynamic fallback order:

```bash
- name: "say-dynamic-message"
  signals:
    - order: "say-dynamic-message"
  neurons:
    - shell:
        cmd: "/path/to/dynamic_message_script.py"
        var: "text"
        stdout_output: true
    - say:
        message: "{{ text }}"
```
The script dynamic_message_script.py is responsible for retrieving or generating the fallback message and passing it to the say neuron.

### 3. Processing Logic in Python
The core script that handles classification and fallback logic is structured as follows:

```bash
from classifier import classify_text, faiss_search

def process_audio_input(text):
    predicted_label, confidence = classify_text(text)

    if confidence >= 0.9:
        return predicted_label
    else:
        response = faiss_search(text)
        return {"order": "say-dynamic-message", "text": response}
```
This function is called by Kalliope's shell neuron or via a wrapper script connected to the voice recognition pipeline.

### How to Add a New Intent Category

To extend the system with a new intent:

1. Update label2id dictionary
    Open your classifier configuration or label2id map (typically in config/ or classifier.py) and add your new label. For example

```bash
    label2id = {
    ...
    "new-intent-name": 50
}
```
    
2. Add training examples
    Add new entries in your dataset (e.g., train.jsonl) using the format:

```bash
{
  "instruction": "Classify the intent of the following sentence.",
  "input": "Turn on the garden lights",
  "output": "new-intent-name"
}
```

3. Retrain the model
    After editing the dataset, retrain your intent classifier:
   
```bash
    python train.py
```

4. Update Kalliope synapse
    Create a new synapse in your Kalliope brain config:

```bash
- name: garden-on
  signals:
    - order: "garden-on"
  neurons:
    - say:
        message: "Turning on the garden lights."
```
